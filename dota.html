            Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game in which players play in two teams of five, 
            competing to destroy a large structure defended by the opposing team known as the "Ancient" whilst defending their own. 
            No matter if it's their 10th or 1,000th hour of play, there's always something new to discover. With regular updates 
            that ensure a constant evolution of gameplay, features, and heroes, Dota 2 has taken on a life of its own.<br>
